I started by first trying to render a leaflet map using react. After looking at a few examples I determined that the best course of action would be to have the map container live in a separate component that accepted latitude and longitude coordinates as properties. After that I converted my old HTML DOM components into react components while keeping the old CSS styling. I needed one component to set a state which was used in another sibling component, so I wrapped both components in a parent component, passing the state variable to one component and the setter function to the other. I had to change some of my previous javascript functions into async/await functions in order for the elements to render properly.

Deploying the live demo website seemed straight forward at first, but I ran into issues with GitHub Pages. The map marker would not render properly because GitHub pages needs absolute paths instead of relative paths, so the importing of the Marker had to be overwritten just like it was in the vanilla javascript project. The background image and button icon were also not rendering because of path issues, this was fixed by moving the images folder from the src to the public folder.

Potential improvements would be to be able to look up IPv6 addresses instead of just IPv4.
